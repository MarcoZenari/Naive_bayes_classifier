# Naive_bayes_classifier
Starting in the 21st century the rise of social network platform has imposed the problem of fake news spreading. Developing algorithms able to classify short paragraphs of text has become a much relevant research area, in roder to identify for example spam, sexual explicit content and mainly fake news.
There are mainly to approach to solve this task: machine learning classification and statistical text classification. In this project we have implemented an algorithm of the second type, the Naive Bayes, to try to classify some short tweets and predict the veridicity of them. We have also used the same algorithm to perform the classification of the area of interest of different tweets. In order to improve the performances we have tokenized the text, cleaned each token and finally implemented a technique known as feature selection. The detailes of these techniques will be discussed in the follow of this notebook. We start now with a theoretical summary on the matter following Ref. [1].
